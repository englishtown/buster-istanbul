# buster-istanbul

busterjs coverage extension

## Getting Started

Add buster-istanbul as a dependency in your package.json file.

```json
{
  "name": "awesome name",
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    "buster-istanbul": "*"
  }
}
```

Configure buster to use buster-istanbul as extension

```javascript
module.exports.tests = {
    environment: "node",

    rootPath : "./",
    sources: [
        "src/**/*.js"
    ],
    tests : [
       "test/**/*-test.js"
    ],
    "buster-istanbul": {
      outputDirectory: "coverage",
      format: "lcov",
      excludes: ["**/*.json"]
    },
    extensions: [
        require('buster-istanbul')
    ]
};
```

**Buster JS options**

`sources` will be the files that will be instrumented.

**buster-istanbul options**

`outputDirectory` is path to where the files will be written to.
Defaults to the current working directory.

`format` is a _string_ or a _list_ of formats to generate.

Currently supported formats:
* lcov
* cobertura
* json
* text
* text-summary

if text and text-summary formats are given, coverage.txt and coverage-summary.txt
files will be generated besides being output to the console at the same time.

`silent` is a flag to turn off reporting at the end of the test run.
Valid values is `true` or `false`. Defaults to `false`.

`instrument` is a flag to turn off instrumentation of your source file.
You will need to handle this yourself. Defaults to `true`.

`excludes` is an array of glob paths that will be excluded from instrumentation.
This can be helpful if your sources include non-js files that needed to be excluded, such as .html or .json files.
Consult [node-glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) for more information on globs.

`sources` is an array of glob paths that will be instrumented in addition to paths supplied in global sources. This
allows paths to be instrumented, but not automatically loaded. Note: This only has effect in a node environment

Write your buster test as usual.
